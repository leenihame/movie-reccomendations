# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains the code and resources for a movie recommendation system. The system aims to suggest movies to users based on their past preferences and the preferences of other similar users.

## Overview

This project implements a collaborative filtering approach to movie recommendations. It leverages user-item interaction data (e.g., movie ratings) to identify patterns and predict movies a user might enjoy.

## Features

* **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on the preferences of users who have similar taste to the target user.
* **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies similar to those the target user has liked in the past.
* **Scalability:** The system is designed to handle a reasonably large dataset of users and movies.
* **Flexibility:** The codebase is modular, allowing for easy experimentation with different similarity metrics and recommendation algorithms.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
* **(Optional) Surprise:** A Python scikit for recommender systems.
* **(Optional) Implicit:** For implicit feedback datasets.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd movie-recommendation-system
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the core libraries manually: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn`)*

3.  **(Optional) Install additional libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install surprise implicit
    ```

## Dataset

The system is designed to work with user-item interaction data. This typically includes:

* **User IDs:** Unique identifiers for each user.
* **Item IDs:** Unique identifiers for each movie.
* **Ratings (Explicit Feedback):** Numerical scores indicating a user's preference for a movie (e.g., 1-5 stars).
* **(Optional) Timestamps:** When the interaction occurred.
* **(Optional) Implicit Feedback:** Data indicating user interactions with movies (e.g., views, purchases) without explicit ratings.

Example data format (for explicit feedback) in a CSV file:

```csv
user_id,movie_id,rating
1,101,4
1,102,5
2,101,3
2,103,4
...
